Once upon a time, in a small yard, there was a small daisy. The daisy had a name. Her name was Daisy. Daisy was very small, but she was also very happy. One day, Daisy saw a dog. The dog was big and had a name too. His name was Max. Max liked to play in the yard. Daisy liked to watch Max play. Max and Daisy became friends. Every day, Max would come to the yard to play. Daisy would watch and smile. They were very happy together. And even though Daisy was small, she knew that she had a big friend in Max. Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to play in her backyard and dig for treasure. One day, she found a shiny treasure chest buried in the ground. Excitedly, she ran inside to tell her mom. "Mommy, mommy! I found a treasure chest!" she exclaimed. Her mom smiled and said, "Wow, that's amazing! Let's open it and see what's inside." When they opened the chest, they found a beautiful dress inside. But the dress was broken and torn. Lily was sad, but her mom said, "Don't worry, we can fix it and make it as good as new." Lily was happy again and couldn't wait to wear her new dress. She knew it would be her most treasured possession. Sammy and his family were getting ready to go on a safari. Sammy had never been on a safari before and he was both excited and a bit scared. Mummy told Sammy, "There is nothing to be scared of darling, just relax and enjoy the adventure!" Sammy put on his hat and sunglasses, gave mummy a hug, and hopped into their family car. After a long drive, the family arrived at the safari. There were a lot of animals to see and Sammy was fascinated. Every time he saw a different animal, he would say, "wow", in his little humble way. They saw elephants, giraffes and zebras, all in the wild being free. Sammy smiled and said, "Mummy, this is the best day ever, and it's so much fun to relax and watch the animals." Once upon a time, there was a little girl named Lily. She loved to paint pictures with her fingers and make colorful messes. One day, her mom cooked beef for dinner and Lily didn't like it because it was too chewy. She said, "Mom, this beef is rude and I don't want to eat it." Her mom was surprised by her choice of words and asked her why she thought the beef was rude. Lily replied, "It's too hard to eat and it doesn't taste good." Her mom explained that it's important to be polite and not use rude words. Later that day, Lily painted a picture of a big red heart and gave it to her mom as an apology for using the word "rude". Her mom was so proud of her and they both enjoyed a yummy dinner together. From that day on, Lily learned to be kind with her words and to express herself through her beautiful paintings.
